                    This might be the fact that Halloween is right around the corner influencing my opinion, but this book cover is definitely a fav. The color scheme, old vintage-like illustration style and font used work so well and peaked my interest the second I saw it. </div>

                    Great title, caught me off guard in the best way possible, making it an absolute fav. The gothic typeface is just *chef’s kiss*. I don't even like cheese and I'd buy it.

                    Terrifying image, could definitely see this living in my worst nightmares. It works for the genre of the book and the mood it’s supposed to give off for readers, but generally just isn’t my cup of tea.

                    Never would’ve thought that this is a genre of books but seeing this from a distance led me into a whole section. While death is a not-so fav, this approach to the subject is. Found out you can be cremated into a vinyl... cool?

                    Just a hard no right off the bat. I feel like the cover is trying too hard and it’s a bit too angsty for my taste. I kinda skimmed through the blurb and didn’t feel like the visuals for the cover even related to what the book’s actually about. I might be completely wrong, but the only way to truly know would be to read the book so… I’ll pass.

                    Ouf, could’ve been executed in a MUCH better way. Feels more like a bad movie poster and less like a book cover. Still, the fact that it evoked me to the point of taking the time to write my strong dislike counts for something I guess.

<div class="aside">And we're back! Did you miss me? There's not much time between one page loading and the next, but still I'll admit
    just this once: I'm starting to grow fond of you. Don't get any ideas though, you're still here to learn about my
    favs and not-so favs, so pay attention. 
<br>
<br>
    This week, I've really been into reading. Or, well, the idea of reading at least. I'm looking for my next book to
    read, with fall weather slowly kicking in it's always nice to have a good book to curl up in bed with. So, I went
    on a little trip to the Barnes & Noble that's nearby (not too near so you can't tell where I live exactly okay... creep).
    While my time spent inside was short-lived and I didn't even leave with a new book, I still came across a few books that
    caught my eye for better or worse. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I don't care what anyone says, I strongly believe in judging a book by its cover. Cut
    the deep inner love metaphorical crap, after you finish a book what you'r left with on a surface level should be an object
    you enjoy looking at. 
    <br>
    <br>
    With that in mind, here are a few of my fav and not-so fav books that I came across. Enjoy!
