    <h1>Week 4: Me & My Camera Roll</h1>

    <p class="text"> So, over this past week, I had to do the unthinkable, 
        something I've been dreading for months now: clearing space off of my phone once and for all. I know, I know, "Basem there
        are more pressing issues than this to have to deal with", but you don't get it. Sure, I would delete an app or two, maybe useless screenshots
        or old text messages, but now it's come to the point where I have to transfer all the photos off my phone for space. 

        While this wasn't the most exciting of things to be doing over the past week, the silver lining is that it gave me a chance to look
        through some of the memories that I made over this past summer and these first few weeks of sophomore year. And even though I'd say for the most
        part the majority of those memories were good, I was also reminded of the bad. 

        With that being said, here are some of my fav and not-so fav photos and the memory I associate to each.

    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="div1">
        August 2nd, 2022: I got all of my wisdom teeth removed in one go, not the best experience. 
            This was my bathroom sink when I first got home. Cool picture, uncool physical pain for three days.
    </div>
     <div class="div2"> July 10th, 2022: Parents were traveling so my younger brother and I had the house to ourselves. 
        Spent the day in, ordered dinner and had a move night with our dog, Goji. His fav human would have to be my brother 
        for sure.</div>
    <div class="div3"> July 3rd, 2022: Picked up my friend Maya from her house and went on adventure all around Amman.
            Felt good to drive again, the view of downtown was comforting, I realized just how homesick I was.</div> 
    <div class="div4"> June 17th, 2022: Closeup shot of the flight manual on the plane from when I went to Cyrpus with
        a few close friends. The trip was great, but this flight was a bit too bumpy for my liking. Arrived anxious and sweaty...
    </div> 
    <div class="div5"> July 8th, 2022: Went to my Teta's house for Eid, at one point I looked out the window and 
        realized how I've seen this same view for years now. I've changed and grown up, but it hasn't that much. A bittersweet feeling.
    </div> 
    <div class="div6"> June 3rd, 2022: Tried FaceTiming my friend Tanya after 3 failed attempts prior to this. You can see the frustration
        in my face. Not towards her, but the time-zone difference and how it messes everything up. 
    </div>   
    <div class="div7"> July 6th, 2022: Remembered the one downside to driving again a.k.a the neverending traffic
        in Amman. Progressively gets worse throughout the day, doesn't help with me being a generally late person.
    </div>   
    <div class="div8"> August 15th, 2022: My first slice of Joe's Pizza after getting back into the city the day before. Felt 
        like the best way to welcome in sophomore year and everything that is yet to come. Red chili flakes are a must, always!
    </div>  
    <div class="div9"> September 17th, 2022: My Dad sent this on the family groupchat and I was having a bit of a rough day,
        it brightened up my mood for some reason. Especially with the background picture I had set of my Teta's lemon trees. 
    </div>  
    <div class="div10"> September 8th, 2022: A pushpin got lodged between my laptop's screen and the keyboard. The tiniest 
    crack did the most damage, screen wouldn't light up and had to send it in for repair for a few days mid assignments.
    </div>
