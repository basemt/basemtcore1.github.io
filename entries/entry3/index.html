<h1 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">Week #3: Fonts</h1>

<p class="text">You're still here! Great, let's pick up right where we left off...sorta. Actually, not even at all, this has nothing to do with groceries.
    Anyways, seeing as I am in fact studying Communication Design (which you may or may not have already known I can't really tell who you are through the screen your camera's a bit too blurry),
    I think it's best to get this category out of the way while I still have your attention (at least I hope I do). 

    I recently had a typography assignment in one of my classes where we had to choose a font to present in class. This led me down a whirlpool of words in all sorts of shapes and strokes and sizes.
    So, in spirit of being a word nerd this entire week, here are some of my fav and not-so fav fonts:
</p>

<span class="span1"><h2>Henny Penny</h2></span>
<div class ="div1"><h4>A fav, feels like something you'd see in a late 90's/early 00's TV show title sequence.</h4></div>

<span class="span2"><h2>Faster One</h2></span>
<div class ="div2"><h4>A not-so fav, I can see what they were going for but it isn't giving the intended effect justice.</h4></div>

<span class="span3"><h2>Creepster</h2></span>
<div class ="div3"><h4>A not-so fav, with Halloween coming up I'd rather something with a bit more character to it than just an oozing effect.</h4></div>

<span class="span4"><h2>Griffy</h2></span>
<div class ="div4"><h4>A fav, this is what Halloween needs. It kinda reminds me of those Tim Burton movies.</h4></div>

<span class="span5"><h2>Alumni Sans Collegiate One</h2></span>
<div class ="div5"><h4>Definitiely a not-so fav. My eyes started to hurt after a while from trying to read this.</h4></div>

<span class="span6"><h2>Barriecito</h2></span>
<div class ="div6"><h4>A fav, something about the contrast throughout makes me think of ransom letters in movies and true crime docs.</h4></div>

<span class="span7"><h2>Kavoon</h2></span>
<div class ="div7"><h4>A fav for sure. Not sure how to put it into words besides that it's bubbly, but in a good way.</h4></div>

<span class="span8"><h2>Fredericka The Great</h2></span>
<div class ="div8"><h4>No. Just... no. Not-so fav and the name is enough justification besides the obvious cringeyness to it.</h4></div>

<span class="span9"><h2>Rubik Moonrocks</h2></span>
<div class ="div9"><h4>Another not-so fav. This reminds me of pimples or warts which shouldn't be something you'd find on letters.</h4></div>

<span class="span10"><h2>Parisienne</h2></span>
<div class ="div10"><h4>A fav for the nostalgic vibe it has, I can imagine it being used in old black and white movies to say "The End".</h4></div>

<span class="span11"><h2>Libre Barcode</h2></span>
<div class ="div11"><h4>This definitely would've been used in a scrappy 2014 tumblr edit... not-so fav.</h4></div>

<span class="span12"><h2>Unifraktur Maguntia</h2></span>
<div class ="div12"><h4>Last but certainly not least, a fav for its gothic style. Another one with slight 
    Halloween-ish tendencies, but mainly vampires/dracula to me.</h4></div>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p class="text"> Well, that's it for now. I hope you enjoyed looking at these fonts as much as I did trying to code them in!
    One of the main things I'd say that I learnt from all of this is that I will in fact judge a book by it's cover, especially if
    any of the not-so favs mentioned here were intentionally used as a stylistic choice. 

    Now, I know I haven't put this in as an option at any point up until now but, did you agree with my opinions? I wanna know what YOU think â™¥
