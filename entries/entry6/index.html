                It's been a long time coming... we're getting a bit deep for this one. 
                <br> <br>
                To be honest, I’ve been feeling kinda all over the place recently. I know, you’re probably 
                used to my somewhat snarky tone by now with all the constant reminders that this is about me while you are simply here to
                spectate (for the most part). However, this past week has shown me that we all need the space to write out our thoughts and feelings sometimes. 
                So, one these next few pieces of paper, you will learn about my fav/not-so fav days and what led me to such conclusions. And if you keep scrolling, maybe you’ll get 
                the chance to write about yours too.

            Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2022 - NOT-SO FAV <br /><br />
            Where to even begin? How about with me not hearing any of my 7+ alarms and waking up at 11:30 am, with a mere ten minutes left for 
            the class I should’ve been at by 9 am. Honestly that just threw me off for the rest of the day. The weather was gloomy, and not the 
            good kind if that makes any sense. I stayed in bed till maybe 5 pm, scrolling mindlessly on my phone. I do this to myself too often: not
            going to sleep at a reasonable time even when I don't have any work that would've kept me up. What is it about those late hours into the 
            night that just gives me comfort? Is it the fact that I'm finally left all to myself?  </div>

            No one to ask me for anything, no responsibilities, no noise... just me. More often than not I fall back into this cycle. It's never been
            too worrying, it only lasts a day or two max. Maybe it has to do with the weather changing and the melancholy that comes so naturally around
            fall/autumn. I was also feeling a bit homesick after seeing a few missed facetime calls from my family. It's instances like this one where the 
            difference in time-zones bites me in the ass.   
            <br> <br>
            I miss my room. This one still doesn't feel like it's mine, and I'm starting to wonder if it ever will. 
            <br> <br> 
            To top it all off, I'm out of cereal.

            Friday, Oct. 14th, 2022 - FAV <br /><br />
            It was a good end to the school week in my opinion. I went to my 9 am class and had a mini crit. for the project we’ve been working on up to that point. 
            The feedback I got was good and I felt more confident in the designs I had made. Since the majority of class-time was dedicated to crit.’s, once 
            I had mine I got the chance to go do some test prints and catch up on some work for my 12 pm class. The break came around and I went to the 
            cafeteria to get some food. Had the 5th ave. Sushi Roll for the first time in a while and it surprisingly tasted better than I remember it being (could’ve been the hunger playing a role but who knows).

            I even had some time to go pick up some coffee before getting back for my next class. We ended up finishing earlier than usual, so I went back to my dorm and freshened up before heading to Brooklyn. 
            Met up with a few of my friends at a nearby park, we had ice cream and then some burgers/fries for dinner and walked around. Got to play around with my new camera too which was fun.  
            I then came back, did my laundry and went to bed early for once. As cheesy as it sounds, it's a Friday like this one after a Wednesday like that which reminds me of the rollercoaster that
        is life, and to just take it one day at a time.
