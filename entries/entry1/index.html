    <h1> ꧁꧁꧁꧁꧁꧁꧁꧁꧁꧁꧁꧁꧁ Hello! ꧂꧂꧂꧂꧂꧂꧂꧂꧂꧂꧂꧂꧂
    </h1>
    <h2>I'm Basem, you probably don't know me (or maybe you do!) but that's besides the point. 
        <br>
        <br> Somehow, you've found your way here so... welcome? congrats? good luck? maybe even all three.</h2>
    <h2>Anyways, this is my ongoing online list of sorts, showcasing all of my likes and dislikes, or what I like to call:</h2>
    <h1>★ MY WEEKLY FAVS & NOT-SO FAVS ★</h1>
    <h2>I don't know if you necessarily care about this, but I also don't expect you to. Still though, I hope you enjoy learning these things about me and the opinions I have. 
        <br>
        <br>Who knows, maybe you'll find a bit of you somewhere in here and we'd be two stranges connecting through a screen. Or maybe it'll be a steaming hot pile of garbage and you'll wanna chuck your laptop into a river out of frustration and disagreement by the end of it.</h2>
    <h2> Either way, I now present to you Week #1: Emojis</h2>
    <h1> --------------- </h1>
    <h1> ✓ THE FAVS:</h1>

    <h3> 1. Bouquet Emoji - I used to use the rose emoji a lot, but once this bouquet emoji came out it instantly replaced that. Something about it feels very wholesome to me and is a way of showing appreciation to someone in a less romantic way than the rose (if that makes sense).
        2. Handshake Emoji - Probably one of my most used emojis at the moment, I find it great for an emphasis on confirming something or showing that I agree in certain contexts. 
        3. Glowing Star Emoji - No set reason, I've just been really into stars lately as a symbol and I find this one step more emotive than the regular star emoji. 
        4. Teddy Bear Emoji - Reminds me of a close friend from home that I miss.
        5. Rat Emoji - I'm in New York, what do you expect.
        6. CD Emoji - The design of it is so satisfying to me for some reason. Also prefer it over the DVD emoji which has a more golden hue to it. 
        7. Box Emoji - I'm curious about what could be inside honestly. I know there'es nothing in there but I let my mind wander. 
        8. Hole Emoji - Part of me wants to jump in and see where it goes, kinda like an Alice in Wonderland type of vibe.

    <h1> ✗ THE NOT-SO FAVS:</h1> 
    <p style="font-size:66px">&#127911;&#128539;&#128123;&#129718;&#129402;&#10175;&#129518;&#128514;</p>
<h3> 1. Headphones Emoji - Nothing against the concept of the emoji itself, just the fact that it's the Airpods Max headphones and I lowkey want a pair but they're way too expensive so I've had to settle for this miniature version on my screen. 
    2. Tonge Sticking Out Emoji - I just find it weird. The eyes don't really match the tongue, feels off and haven't seen anyone use it before. 
    3. Ghost Emoji - Reminds me of middle school. ALso snapchat in its early days. 
    4. Feather Emoji - When would I use this is my genuine question. 
    5. Pouting Emoji - No. Just... no. This emoji had a good run when it first got released but now it's more on the cringey side. 
    6. Double Loop Emoji - Again, when would I use this. 
    7. Abacus Emoji - Yes I had to search up the name of the emoji and no I don't know how to properly use one because math is not and will not be my strong suit at any point in time. 
    8. Laughing Emoji - Depends on how you're using it. I know it's a fan favorite for milennials/other generations but with today's culture surrrounding it, there's a fine line between sending it and being serious vs. out of irony.
