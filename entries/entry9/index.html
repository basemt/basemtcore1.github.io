            <p>With finals creeping around the corner, I can confidently say that I don’t have the time to play around with u as much as I did in the weeks before. 
                Still, I’ll try my best to keep u somewhat intrigued. This week’s q: coffee or tea? Ugh what the heck... who am I kidding I don’t even have time to care which you prefer! 
                But the only answer should be coffee or iced coffee to be exact. I had a whole convo about this specific with a friend a few days ago. Regardless of the weather conditions, 
                I will always go for iced coffee over hot coffee unless I’m severely sick. I don’t think it’s that weird or a ‘hot take’ but who knows.  
        
                Anyways, seeing as I have all this finals work to catch up on and can only do so by gluing myself down to a chair for hours on end, I spent the week on what I now call 
                a “caffeine crawl”. I had coffee at a different place every day of the week and now u get to see my unfiltered thoughts on which are my favs and not-so favs... click the right one to continue! 
                or play around with this page and maybe you'll stumble upon some other info... </p>

        <div class="item4">
<p>1. Coffee was originally chewed.
    Sipping may be your preferred method of java consumption, but coffee has not always been a liquid treat. According to a number of historians, the first African tribes to consume coffee did so by grinding the berries together, adding in some animal fat, and rolling these caffeinated treats into tiny edible energy balls.
    
    2. Drinking decaf coffee fuels the soda industry.
    After coffee beans are decaffeinated, several coffee manufacturers sell the caffeine to soda and pharmaceutical companies.
    
    3. Instant coffee has been around for nearly 250 years.
    Instant coffee has been around for a while, making its first appearance in England in 1771. But it would take another 139 years for the first mass-produced instant coffee to be introduced (and patented) in the U.S. in 1910.

    4. The average American spends about $2000 on coffee each year.
    According to The Perfect Brew, women drop approximately $2327 per year on coffee while men spend just a tiny bit less, at around $1,934 per year. You’d think that spending that kind of money would be enough to make America the world’s most caffeinated nation. But you would be wrong ...
    
    5. Finland is the world’s coffee capital.
    Though Finland does not produce any beans of its own, its citizens drink a lot of the brown stuff. The average Finn drinks about 4 cups of coffee each day—the most of any country in the world.
    
    6. Beethoven was a barista’s worst nightmare.
Beethoven enjoyed a cup of coffee, and was extremely particular about its preparation; he insisted that each cup he consumed be made with exactly 60 beans.

7. Coffee beans sent Brazilian athletes to the Olympics in 1932.
In 1932, Brazil couldn’t afford to send its athletes to the Olympics in Los Angeles. So they loaded their ship with coffee and sold it along the way.

8. There have been several attempts to ban coffee entirely.
As recently as the 18th century, governments were trying to eradicate coffee. Among the many reasons for outlawing the beverage were its tendency to stimulate “radical thinking.” In 1746 Sweden took things to an extreme when it banned both coffee and coffee paraphernalia (i.e. cups and saucers).

9. Coffee could extend your cat’s life.
Maybe it’s a coincidence, but the Guinness World Record holder for “Oldest Cat Ever”—a 38-year-old kitty named Creme Puff—drank coffee every morning of her furry little life (plus enjoying bacon, eggs, and broccoli). Before you dismiss that outright, consider this: The cat that Creme Puff beat out for the record (a 34-year-old cat, appropriately named Grandpa Rex Allen) had the same owner, and was fed the exact same diet.

10. 17th-century women thought coffee was turning their men into “useless corpses.”
In 1674, the Women’s Petition Against Coffee claimed the beverage was turning British men into “useless corpses" and proposed a ban on it for anyone under the age of 60.

11. Chock Full o'Nuts coffee contains exactly zero nuts.
The brand is named for a chain of nut stores the founder later converted into coffee shops. But the name stuck (no matter how confusing it may have been.)

         <h1> coffee health benefits! </h1> 
        </div>
        <div class="item6">
<p>Though researchers don't always know exactly which of coffee's ingredients are responsible for producing their studies' health-boosting results, there's evidence that drinking coffee may help do the following:

    1. Improve overall health.
    An analysis of nearly 220 studies on coffee, published in the BMJ in 2017, found that coffee drinkers may enjoy more overall health benefits than people who don't drink coffee.
    
    The analysis found that during the study period, coffee drinkers were 17% less likely to die early from any cause, 19% less likely to die of heart disease and 18% less likely to develop cancer than those who don't drink coffee.
    
    2. Protect against Type 2 diabetes. 
    A 2014 study by Harvard researchers published in the journal Diabetologica tracked nearly 124,000 people for 16 to 20 years.
    
    Those who increased their coffee intake by more than a cup a day over a four-year period had an 11% lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes; those who decreased their intake by one cup per day had a 17% higher risk of developing the disease.
    
    The reason may be the antioxidants in coffee, which reduce inflammation (inflammation contributes to your Type 2 diabetes risk).
    
    If you already have Type 2 diabetes, however, you should avoid caffeinated products, including coffee. Caffeine has been shown to raise both blood sugar and insulin levels in people with the disease. 
    
    3. Control Parkinson's disease symptoms.
    A number of studies have suggested that consuming caffeine can reduce your risk of developing Parkinson's disease — and research published in 2012 in the journal of the American Academy of Neurology showed that a daily dose of caffeine equivalent to that found in two eight-ounce cups of black coffee can help to control the involuntary movements of people who already have the disease. (You'd have to drink nearly eight cups of brewed black tea to get the same amount of caffeine.)
    
    4. Slow the progress of dementia.
    In a 2012 study published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, Florida researchers tested the blood levels of caffeine in older adults with mild cognitive impairments, which can be a precursor to severe dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.
    
    When the researchers re-evaluated the subjects two to four years later, those whose blood levels contained caffeine amounts equivalent to about three cups of coffee were far less likely to have progressed to full-blown dementia than those who had consumed little or no caffeine.
    
    5. Safeguard the liver.
    Several studies published in respected journals have found that coffee drinking has beneficial effects on the liver, including reducing the risk of death from liver cirrhosis, decreasing harmful liver enzyme levels and limiting liver scarring in people who have hepatitis C.
    
    6. Promote heart health.
    According to a study published in 2021 in the American Heart Association journal Circulation: Heart Failure, drinking one or more daily cups of plain, caffeinated coffee was associated with a significant reduction in a person's long-term risk of heart failure. 
    
    The study looked at the original data from thee well-known heart disease studies: the Framingham Heart Study, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study. 
    
    Although there's not enough evidence to support prescribing coffee to lower your risk of heart disease risk, this recent revelation seems to strengthen previous findings that coffee is, in fact, good for heart health.
    
    In 2013, the journal Epidemiology and Prevention published a review of studies analyzing the correlation between coffee consumption and cardiovascular disease. Data from 36 different studies showed that people who drink three to five cups of coffee per day had a lower risk of heart disease than those who drink no coffee or more than five cups per day.
    
    While the reason isn't clear, one possibility is that coffee helps to improve blood vessels' control over blood flow and blood pressure.
    
    7. Reduce melanoma risk.
    A 2015 study appearing in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute looked at the coffee-drinking habits of more than 447,000 people over 10 years. The researchers found that those who drank four or more cups of caffeinated coffee each day had a 20% lower risk of developing melanoma than people who drank decaffeinated coffee or no coffee.
    
    8. Lower mortality risk
    Your morning coffee could help lower your risk of death. A 2022 study in The Annals of Internal Medicine has shown that moderate consumption of unsweetened and sugar-sweetened coffee was associated with a reduced risk of mortality. The research shows that those who drank 1.5 to 3.5 cups of coffee per day, including with sugar, had a 30% less lower risk of death from any cause during the study.
