A fav. I would say this is my current go-to on a regular basis, but that’s more because of my coffee subscription and not for the place itself. The subscription is great tbh. I can have up to 5 drinks a day (with a 30 minute wait period between each) and only have to pay $30/month!                     <br>

                    Would definitely come back, I can sit in here for hours on end and get shit done. Only issue is that the presence of WiFi isn't always a guarantee. There'es been months where it's no longer available and others where it's fine... weird.</div>

                    A dash of simple syrup that I measure by eye at the stand by the door before leaving.
                    <br>
                    Another fav. Would definitely say that it's on the pricier side in comparison to some of the others, but everytime I have it I'm reminded that it is indeed worth it. It's sweet, creamy, and mellowed with chicory. I mean, what more could I ask for?

                    Only slight issue is the small seating space at the nearest branch to me, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't go the extra mile and work at one of their larger branches if I really wanted to.

                    Okay...look. Maybe it's the fact that I tried to mix it up with another plant milk and opted out for any added sweetness, but I know I wouldn't come back here. Not-so Fav for sure. The coffee itself is subpar AND overpriced.

                    Also, I didn't really notice it properly at first, but there's a weird smell constantly lingering inside. Might be something they bake/cook? I dont know. All I'm sure of is that I am not coming back here anytime soon.

                    <br>
                    I always used to walk past two of their locations and always said to myself that I should try it out but never found the time till now. Besides my general bias towards their clean, minimal aesthetic, I actually really enjoyed the coffee. It was the right level of coffee to almond milk in my opinion. And even though I didn't specify the amount of syrup (which has been an issue of sugar overload in some past instances), it was just the right sweetness.

                    I caved in and decided to try this because it's been a constant on my TikTok timeline since freshman year. And like some of the comments that I read before taking the risk and coming, I regret my decision. 
                    It tasted like battery acid and just wasn't what I was looking for when it came to a dose of coffee. I feel like in all fairness, when the cafe is an extension of a local clothing store and not a genuine business solely focusing on coffee, baked goods, etc. there should always be some level of hesitance... in this case it was justified.

                    Maybe i'm just being iffy but the only reason this is a not-so fav has less to do with the coffee and more to do with the general atmosphere in being there. First of all, the WiFi runs out after 2-ish hours and you need to ask for a reciept to get the access code otherwise you're out of luck. Oh and to add to it, besides the running timer on your WiFi access you need to log in IMMEDIATELY because there's a 15 minute timer before the codes on the reciepts expire. 
                    All that aside, I'd say the coffee is okay. Still, the only reason I'm going to be coming back is because they take my campus card dining dollars.

                    I heard about this place from a friend of mine who always picks up coffee from there and so I had to try it out. I guess you could say the whole "craze" behind it is the fact that everything, and I mean everything, they serve is priced at $2.50. And for being so price-friendly, I do have to say the coffee is of good quality. 
The one issue: the place (or maybe just the branch I went to I'm not sure) is very tiny, and there's only a small seating area outside. Not to mention with everyone fiending over it, if you do pickup you will walk in to find a sea of coffee cups on the counter to look through.                </div>

Well, that's all I have for you now! I hope this inspired you to go out on your own caffeine crawl. Then again, there's nothing wrong with staying in and just making yourself a cup of coffee and working from home. You do you. Also pick the right iced latte above to move onwards ♥
