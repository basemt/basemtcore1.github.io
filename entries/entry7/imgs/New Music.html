        <p>Alright, time to cut the crap and get out of our feels for a bit. After a deep last entry, let's lighten the mood with a quick music fix!
            So, I don't know about you and what genre/s of music you like listening to, but if I can have one hope for both of our sake's it's that
            you don't like country music, because that's the constant not-so fav that it's not even worth putting into this page. 
            Anyways, for this week, I took it upon myself to listen through Spotify's running playlist of top hits and new music releases, and decided
            on what would be my current top 3 favs and not-so favs. The catch? I'm not going to just hand over my valuable opinions to you as easily as 
            I did in previous weeks. Instead, you're going to have to work for it.
